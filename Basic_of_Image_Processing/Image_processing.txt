Image Dimension:

a image dimension 200*200. consider it as the height and width is divided into 200 small boxes. total pixels: 40,000.
resolution = w*h
480p resolution will be 720*480
720p resolution will be 1080*720

Type of images:
1. Grayscale image: have only 1 channel. black and white. data size is smaller
2. RGB image: has 3 channels. Red, Greeen and Blue. data size is bigger

Image Process:

Grayscale:
the image is convert into only one matrix.
a 200*200 image is convert into a 200 by 200 matrix.
each box is assigned a number between 0 to 255.

properties:
1. all pixels value lies between 0 to 255.
2. 0 means black and 255 means white
3. this value represents the white color intensity

RGB image:

1. each image is converted into 3 matirces.
2. first matrix presents the Red Color Intensity.
3. second matrix presents Green Color Intensity.
4. second matrix presents Blue Color Intensity.
5. all pixels value lies between 0 to 255.
